        Hi, this is a little bit about me, the side of me that isn't behind a
        computer screen. I'm Haitian and I carry that part of my culture
        proudly, especially when it comes to cuisine. I was actually born in
        Haiti but I moved to America, spending the majority of my time since in
        South Florida. I moved to Orlando because I got into UCF in Spring 2023.
        My family, as seen in the slideshow below does a great job of keeping
        the Haitian and South Floridian culture instilled in me. I'm currently a
        third year Computer Science major, looking to make the best of the rest
        of my time here.
      </p>

        Outside of school, my main hobbies revolve around being active. I love
        basketball, it's my favorite sport. I enjoy playing it, I enjoy watching
        into football here and there in support of the Washington Commanders. I
        also like to go to the gym. There's just something so therapeutic about
        picking up heavy stuff. That combined with the aesthetic, strength, and
        health benefits had me fall in love with the gym in no time.
